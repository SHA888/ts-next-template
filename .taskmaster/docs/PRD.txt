# Overview  
TS Next Template is a modern, full-stack web application template designed to accelerate development of scalable and maintainable web applications. It solves the problem of time-consuming project setup by providing a production-ready foundation with best practices, type safety, and modern tooling out of the box. This template is valuable for developers and teams looking to quickly bootstrap new projects with Next.js and TypeScript while maintaining flexibility for customization.

# Core Features  

## 1. Next.js 14+ with App Router
- **What it does**: Provides file-based routing, server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and API routes.
- **Why it's important**: Enables building fast, SEO-friendly applications with optimal performance.
- **How it works**: Uses the App Router for better performance and developer experience, with support for React Server Components.

## 2. TypeScript Integration
- **What it does**: Enforces type safety across the entire codebase.
- **Why it's important**: Reduces runtime errors and improves developer experience with better IDE support.
- **How it works**: TypeScript is configured with strict mode enabled, with shared types between frontend and backend.

## 3. Prisma ORM
- **What it does**: Provides type-safe database access.
- **Why it's important**: Ensures database operations are type-safe and reduces runtime errors.
- **How it works**: Uses Prisma Client for type-safe database queries with support for multiple databases.

## 4. Tailwind CSS
- **What it does**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **Why it's important**: Enables consistent, responsive design without leaving your JSX/TSX.
- **How it works**: Pre-configured with sensible defaults and easy customization through tailwind.config.js.

## 5. Developer Experience Tools
- **What it does**: Includes ESLint, Prettier, Husky, and lint-staged.
- **Why it's important**: Enforces code quality and consistent formatting across the project.
- **How it works**: Automatic linting and formatting on commit, with pre-configured rules.

# Technical Architecture  

## System Components
1. **Frontend**
   - Next.js 14+ with App Router
   - React 18+ with Server Components
   - TypeScript for type safety
   - Tailwind CSS for styling

2. **Backend**
   - Next.js API Routes
   - Prisma ORM for database access
   - Type-safe API layer

3. **Database**
   - Supports multiple databases via Prisma
   - PostgreSQL recommended for production
   - MongoDB supported for document storage

## Data Models
- **Base Model**: Common fields (id, createdAt, updatedAt)
- **User Model**: Authentication and profile data
- **Example Models**: Extendable for specific use cases

## APIs and Integrations
- **RESTful API**: Built with Next.js API Routes
- **Type-safe API Client**: Auto-generated from API routes
- **Third-party Integrations**:
  - Authentication providers (NextAuth.js)
  - File storage (AWS S3, Cloudinary)
  - Email services (SendGrid, Resend)

## Infrastructure Requirements
- **Development**: Node.js 18+, npm/yarn
- **Production**:
  - Vercel (recommended)
  - Node.js server (AWS, Render, etc.)
  - Database (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.)
  - Object storage (if needed)

# Development Roadmap  

## Phase 1: Core Setup (MVP)
1. **Project Initialization**
   - Set up Next.js with TypeScript
   - Configure ESLint, Prettier, and Husky
   - Add Tailwind CSS and basic styling

2. **Database Layer**
   - Set up Prisma with example models
   - Create database migration scripts
   - Implement base repository pattern

3. **Authentication**
   - Implement NextAuth.js
   - Set up email/password and OAuth providers
   - Create protected routes

## Phase 2: Developer Experience
1. **API Layer**
   - Create type-safe API utilities
   - Implement error handling middleware
   - Add request validation

2. **Testing**
   - Set up Jest and React Testing Library
   - Add unit and integration tests
   - Configure test coverage reporting

3. **Documentation**
   - Complete README with setup instructions
   - Add API documentation
   - Create contribution guidelines

## Phase 3: Production Readiness
